👉array can be sorted in O(n) time complexity wiyh single pass(only one loop used)
👉for this we use three pointers low , mid , high 

🧶 0's -> 0 to low -1
🧶 1's -> low to mid -1 
🧶 2's -> high+1 to n-1
🧶The unsorted part lies within mid to high 

👉As we proceed unsorted part will be shorten and sorted part will grow

👉until mid<=high we continue the loop but when mid = high that means we do not have
any unsorted element left within the array

trial :-
0000 1111 [] 2222
