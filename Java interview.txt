✅ Since we are not storing anything in the variables of the BinaryToDecimal class 
that needs to be accessed, we declare binaryToDecimal as a static method 
so it can be called directly from main() without creating an object.

✅ all static methods are declared in the same general way in Java

✅When to use static methods:
Use a static method when:

The method doesn't depend on instance (object) variables.

You want to call it without creating an object.

It's a utility/helper function like math operations, conversions, etc.

✅ Why is main static?
Because Java starts the program without creating any object of your class.

So, the main method has to be static so the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can call it directly using the class name — without creating an object first.

🧠 Think of it like this:
static means: "This belongs to the class, not to any object."

When the program starts, no object exists yet, so the JVM needs something it can access directly.

That’s why Java says: “Make main static so I (JVM) can run it right away!”

🔁 If main was not static?
Java wouldn’t know how to start your program because it would need an object — but there's no object created yet!

✅ Java requires the class name to match the file name so the JVM can find and load the correct class and run main() without creating an object.
This works because main is static, and static methods belong to the class — not to any object.
🔁 If class name ≠ file name (and class is public):
You’ll get a compile-time error

✅A .class file is created when you compile your code because Java first translates your code into bytecode, which the JVM can then execute.

🧾 Why is a .class file created when you run a Java program?
Because Java is a compiled language — meaning your .java file (which you write) is first compiled into a .class file (which the computer runs).

🔍 Here's what happens step-by-step:
You write Java code
File: Hello.java

You compile it using javac Hello.java
➤ This creates a file: Hello.class

You run it using java Hello
➤ The JVM reads the Hello.class file and starts from the main() method.

🧠 What is a .class file?
It contains bytecode — a special set of instructions that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) understands.

Bytecode is not human-readable, but the JVM can execute it on any platform (Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.).

That’s why Java is called "platform independent" — you write code once, compile to bytecode, and it runs anywhere JVM is installed!


🔍 Line:
public static void main(String args[])

Let’s break it down word by word:

1. public
This is an access modifier.

It means this method is accessible from anywhere — including by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) when it starts your program.

2. static
It means this method belongs to the class, not to any object.

So, JVM can call it without creating an object of the class.

3. void
This means the method does not return anything.

It just runs code, but it doesn't give back a result.

4. main
This is the name of the method.

It is special: JVM looks for this exact method to start your program

5. String args[]
This is a parameter: it’s an array of Strings.

It holds command-line arguments (if you give any when running the program).

Note : 
Command-line Arguments
You provide them when you run the program.

They're passed via the terminal or command prompt.

They're stored in the String args[] array. Also difference between user input and command line arguments
